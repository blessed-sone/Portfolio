# WHO AM I?
My main interest in cybersecurity is to stop the bad guys by actively working to identify and analyze potential risks, 
threats and vulnerabilities to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of assets of the organization 
I work for to always be a step ahead of these bad guys.
The values I hold strongly and which I am committed to develop more are honesty, 
law-abiding, punctual and fairness.
